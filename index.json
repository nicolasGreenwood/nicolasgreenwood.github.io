Credit: Wikimedia Commons License: Public Domain\nA note on this poem: It is not the first time the shadow of inevitability—rather unintentionally, I admit—has crept into my poetry. It is such a poetic idea, you know, to be aware of one’s own nonsense, to sing of the unpreventable. This is not always a negative thing. In this poem, however, it is.\nThis is, unapologetically, a composition on oppression. Not just any oppression, but the kind where the line separating the oppressor and the oppressed blurs. Such is the worst kind of tormentor: the kind who torments by causing the victim to torment themselves. Their return, after so many visits, comes as no surprise to the narrator.\nTruly, it comes as no surprise to see you again with your enflamed face and bloodied eyes and your harsh, unending, hellish cries. I say, I’ve known this face before from beneath sleepless eyelids sore from tears and terror-stricken nights and clouded skies and blinding lights and subtle knocking at my door. Truly, it comes as no surprise to hear you again, as within my own heart sinks and organs rise to fill my mouth with blood and lies I swallow before your very eyes. Like an old friend you stop by of bygone days to reflect and query why my brow is fresh and eyelids dry my hands are clean and dreams are sweet and how dare I hold my head so high! Like a tender father you bend the knee stroke my cheek and ask of me how I could’ve strayed from the only way you’ve taught to me and ventured past the gate to see from beyond the hills the sunlight rise and dry this pair of tear-stained eyes —no, indeed, your thought of me —truly, it comes as no surprise.","href":"https://nicolasgreenwood.github.io/poems/truly-it-comes-as-no-surprise/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2025-09-15T00:00:00Z","objectID":"4744c5a3bea5bab98a056bd565240764","publishDate":"2025-09-15T00:00:00Z","section":"poems","tags":[],"title":"Truly, It Comes as No Surprise","type":"poems"},{"content":"In memoriam, Vladislav Petković Dis\n(1880-1917)\nWe sink, for the shore\u0026rsquo;s to far to see We fall from a dark and ominous sky To the depths of the Ionian Sea.

A note on this poem: Serbian poet Vladislav Petković Dis (1880 - 1917)\nVladislav Petković Dis was one of the greatest Serbian impressionist poets. During my time in Čačak, Serbia, I had the privilege to volunteer for some time in the district library, which is named after him. Dis’s birthplace, Zablaće, is a small village only a few kilometers outside the city of Čačak. As my days of volunteering drew closer to an end at his library, writing a poem in his commemoration was all but inevitable.\nPetković Dis, as you may have noticed reading his life dates above, did not live a very long life. With a weak constitution that followed him to his final day, Dis’s life is one marked with moments of great joy but also great tragedy. On May 30th, 1917, at the age of 37, while returning from France to Corfu to rejoin his exiled nation on the Salonica front of WWI, a torpedo from an Austro-Hungarian U-boat sunk the passenger steamship carrying Dis, sinking the poet and many on board to the depths of the Ionian Sea.","href":"https://nicolasgreenwood.github.io/poems/to-the-depths-of-the-ionian-sea/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2025-06-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"2be13dac2e8c841ebbe50543693fc53e","publishDate":"2025-06-19T00:00:00Z","section":"poems","tags":[],"title":"To the Depths of the Ionian Sea","type":"poems"},{"content":"Moths dance in the streetlight as You lean on my shoulder.

Кад падају сузе — оне су пале, заувек. Јер крв, кад се проли, више не остаје у телу. Јер сећања не могу бити иста као стварност. Сурово је то време. Сурово је то време јер где је смрт прошла, живот не прати. Јер је прошлост нешто што не постоји. А оно што видимо — нестане и нестане! Сваки тренутак је пролазни тренутак. Сурово је то време. Мило је то време јер кад дува ветар — дува у налетима. Јер у истом дану сунце сија с обе стране неба. Јер нам даје крај пре него што живот постане предуг и горак. Мило је то време. Мило је то време јер ни добро ни зло не постају вечни. Јер сузе, када падну, падну — и пресуше. А време даје лепоти њену круну, јер лепота, кад је пролазна, бива још лепша. Мило је то време. English translation Time Cruel is time because When darkness falls, that day cannot return When tears fall, they are fallen forever Because blood, when spilled, remains not in the body Because memories are not the same as reality Cruel is time. Cruel is time because Where death has passed, life does not follow Because the past is something that doesn’t exist And everything we see — vanishes and vanishes!1 Every moment is a passing moment Cruel is time. Merciful is time because When wind blows, it blows in gusts. Because in the same day the sun shines on both sides of the sky. Because it gives us an end before Life becomes long and bitter.

In this year\u0026rsquo;s event, I was given the opportunity to read one of my works to live audience for the very first time.\nPhoto courtesy of Čačak City Library Vladislav Petković Dis\nReading poetry out loud is an entirely different experience to reading to yourself. Poetic language isn\u0026rsquo;t always rational and predictable, and there\u0026rsquo;s something about hearing it out loud that makes you slow down a little, hang on longer to each word and appreciate its artistic courage even more.\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t easy, either. Reciting a poem is a joint experience between the narrator and the audience. The narrator has to understand the poem well in order to know when to pause, how to intonate, how to make understanding the current line while keeping the previous line lingering in the audience\u0026rsquo;s memory as effortless as possible. The best recital is always the one where the narrator understands, loves and immerses themself in the poem they\u0026rsquo;re reading. Enthusiasm can\u0026rsquo;t be artificial on stage.\nI was more fortunate than most in this regard: one\u0026rsquo;s own work is the easiest to recite. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to struggle to understand or wonder about when it\u0026rsquo;s your very own work.\nThe Gymnasium school in Čačak, where we rehearsed our recitals | Credit: Ванилица License: CC BY-SA 4.0\nThat didn\u0026rsquo;t mean practice wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary. Along with several other students selected to recite that day and guided by professor of literature Ana Ranđić, we met several times to rehearse our pieces and perfect the event plan in an empty classroom inside the Gymnasium high school in Čačak.\nI know what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking, and yes, I did nearly faint from stage fright sitting in front of our humble audience when the day finally came. It was only my poetry that kept me calm and focused. All I tried to think of was what inspired my work, why I\u0026rsquo;d written it and who I\u0026rsquo;d written it for. Only such grand and inspiring things could have carried me, a hopeless introvert, through such an ordeal. And, of course, the kindness and understanding of everyone who worked with me following up to the event. Their consideration and enthusiasm was an inspiration in itself.\nThe moment of recital | Photo courtesy of Čačak City Library Vladislav Petković Dis\nThe poem chosen for the event was a translated excerpt of my longer poem Proleće, meaning Spring in Serbian. During my volunteer work at the Libary, my mentor and several other librarians worked with me to translate the final part, Proleće from beneath stars, into Serbian. The result, thanks to their input, felt much more satisfying and original than I had expected possible for a translation. Special thanks to Ms. Marija Radulović, Ms. Tanja Vuković and my mentor Ms. Nataša Krivačević Popović for their time and assistence in translating my work.\n2024 Young Dis Award laureate Simona Dmitrović | Photo courtesy of Čačak City Library Vladislav Petković Dis\nThe first half of the event was dedicated to 2024 Young Dis Award laureate Simona Dmitrović and her poetry collection Osim šumskog požara. Also present at the even were Gymnasium high school students Arijana Sofija Timotijević, Natalija Ćurčić and Mateja Bošković, while the music played intermittently throughout the program was performed by the incredibly talented Gymnasium graduate Luka Spasojević.\nI would like to express my deepest gratitude to the City Library of Čačak for giving me the opportunity to participate in the event, as well as to everyone else who helped me along the way, from the friends who patiently read everything I write to those who, by simply being a part of my life, encourage and inspire me more than they will ever know.\nPhoto Gallery Photos courtesy of Čačak City Library Vladislav Petković Dis","href":"https://nicolasgreenwood.github.io/articles/disovizija-2025-my-first-public-poetry-recital/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2025-05-01T00:00:00Z","objectID":"c988fb09bf74201d73a356019aef6d0c","publishDate":"2025-05-01T00:00:00Z","section":"articles","tags":[],"title":"Disovizija 2025: My First Public Poetry Recital","type":"articles"},{"content":"Writing poetry isn\u0026rsquo;t easy. But, contrary to popular belief, the difficulty isn\u0026rsquo;t so much in the structure, in the rhyming — it\u0026rsquo;s what to write about. Just think of it: come up with a poem topic. All kinds of ideas pop into your head, from nature to love to grief. Now, forget rhyming. Forget structure, forget that syllables even exist. Try to express the feeling in your chest. A first line tumbles out. Words fail you. It sounds like a conversation, like you\u0026rsquo;re about to unload a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of life events to a friend. It sounds almost ridiculous, like anything but the elegance, the neatness, the perfection that is a poem. And by the time you reach line 3, you\u0026rsquo;ve lost any idea of what to write about. The feeling still burns in your chest, but words? They don\u0026rsquo;t come. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to express it. No metaphors come to mind. And soon that sweet rush of inspiration you had when you picked up your pen fades into something between a headache and the flush of frustration.\nAnd you know what? It\u0026rsquo;s entirely normal. It\u0026rsquo;s why true, beautiful poetry is rare. It\u0026rsquo;s why a poem, when it\u0026rsquo;s finished, means something. What is a poem? Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a piece of writing that reads differently than prose — it flows, or it rhymes, or it almost sings. But it\u0026rsquo;s more than that. Unlike a story, or a novel, a poem can be nothing more than a flash of light. It can be a glimpse, a feeling. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need context. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a background story. All it needs to do is express. And in that lies the power of the poem over other forms of written art.\nMuch like a painting, or a piece of music, poetry\u0026rsquo;s often lack of background makes it so much more relatable to admirers. A poet can write a poem about jealousy, for example, based on a personal experience; and someone else reading his work experiencing jealousy in an entirely different context can find solace in the poet\u0026rsquo;s naked expressions of the emotion. Novels and stories also carry this potential, but often the reader must isolate a part of the narrative to apply it to themselves. Expressive poetry skips this step. It strips the emotion from the situation and presents it bare and brief to the reader\u0026rsquo;s eye, ripe for consumption. And there is no greater satisfaction than reading a poem expressing exactly as you feel. Not only can it satisfy—it can comfort, heal, resolve, and beautify life itself.\nWith this in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s go back and approach our attempt at poetry once again. This time, forget the context. Forget the background story. What did you feel? Anger? Love? Grief? Joy? A bizarre blend of all of those? Now, pick up the pen. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to define them—dictionaries are for that. No, just express them. When you were angry, what did you see? The faces of those you were angry at seemed revolting to you, suddenly. Exaggerate that. Describe how their features became distorted, for example. Make eyeballs and lips twist and curl into something grotesque. Describe the light turning red. Let your imagination fly.\nAnd be authentic, entirely. Were there dashes of a strange, passionate love in your anger? The volatility of human emotion makes for excellent poetry. Use it to your advantage. Suddenly, the distorted face seems beautiful to you. Those eyes you once raged at, you yet rage at, shine back at you in confusion and fear. All at once, you\u0026rsquo;re in love with those eyes. And you falter, your voice fading into silence.\nWell, there you go, I got a little carried away with my description, but I hope the idea makes sense to you. The more personal, the more relatable it will be to others who experienced the same emotion. Make it intimate, make it vivid. Exaggerate eloquently. And think of words that describe, not necessarily words that make sense. Because in poetry, only authenticity makes sense.\nOkay, you\u0026rsquo;ve written something. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s a mess — it looks like one of your diary entries after a bad day. If that piece of writing was a picture, it\u0026rsquo;d be one of Jackson Pollock\u0026rsquo;s works. Somehow, through the scribbling, there\u0026rsquo;s a spirit of elegance to it — some sort of powerful honesty to it all. But, it still needs work.\nModern poetry is very accommodating of individuality. Indeed, one might say that individuality is its only standard. While this is seen as a triumph by some, others see it as many do contemporary visual art: a sad testament to the end of the era of great, true art; art that took technical skill, art with a beauty anyone could recognize. But in the end, we must ask ourselves: what is art? And why do we do it? Art, very briefly, is the expression of feeling through an artistic medium, like sculpting, music and so on. And why do we do it? The answer will vary for many, but to me it will always be the pursuit of beauty. Beauty, wisps of it, are everywhere, just escaping our reach. And poetry captures those wisps, expresses them sincerely, without censor, and draws our attention to them.\nWhen we think of modern poetry, and indeed all modern art with this in mind, it becomes clearer to us why the art of today is the way it is, and even, one might say, its inevitability that it would become so. For purity of expression and the pursuit of beauty bend not to human judgment and perception. They exist outside of our tastes, and the way we choose to express them matters less. What matters is authenticity. What matters is truth. Art and its history are like one great journey of discovery; a great search for some unknown mystery—some great thing we know we must find, even though we don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is. Poetry, when sincere, is an indispensable guide in this great pursuit. And modern art, though it has shed much of the technical skill and understandability of the art of the past, yet retains this integrity to authenticity. One might even say it elevates to new heights, as it leaves behind all the trappings and decorations of technical skill that might be mistaken for artistic value to the untrained eye, and exposes truth and reality raw and bloody to stand alone in front of our eyes.\nAnd now, when you look at your attempted poem, that bad diary entry, that elegance you noticed blossoming through the chaos makes more sense. The truth is there. Your contribution to the great search for the unknown thing that is art is on the paper. It can stay as it is, and it would be beautiful in its own, raw way.\nStill, some correction is helpful. Minimalism is essential in modern poetry, and carving your piece into something that not only expresses, but expresses neatly, and without excess, purifies your poem. Read it, and think of ways to put what you meant without phrases, without cliché, without unnecessary articles. Let each line linger on your tongue—short, but flavorful. Make it vivid, make it sudden. Whisper it to yourself with your eyes closed. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to use a simple word if it\u0026rsquo;s the right one. And the same goes for complex, longer words.\nRead it from start to finish. It should flow, but not so much in words as in images, emotions and pauses. It should tell a story, but not a typical story—it should tell the tale of how you felt, the things you saw, and stop there. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to say why. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to say where, when and how. It just\u0026hellip;happened. And there\u0026rsquo;s no need to question it.\nThis is all fine and well, but often, even with our newly-acquired understanding of how emotions turn into lines of poetry, we will find ourselves at loss for words. The truth is, there are no perfectly accurate words to describe emotional experiences, and there probably never will be. Poems are attempts at just that—we swirl together bizarre mixes of color, nostalgia and visions all to describe one simple feeling. And even then, we fail. The delight of poetry only lies in the attempt to describe it—not the successful description. Still, there are ways to help us make better and better attempts at description. And one of the greatest methods of doing so is listening to music.\nMusic is poetry in sound—but it\u0026rsquo;s more than that. It defies the rules of expression in many respects. I mean, just think of it: the fact that a series of sounds—basically different kinds of vibrations in the air—arranged in some sort of sequence would be able to convey any emotional meaning is downright incredible in itself. And the variety of emotions we can express is practically limitless. Why is this so? Why can our brains understand emotion in a sequence of individually flat and meaningless vibrations?\nWhile I don\u0026rsquo;t pretend to know the answer to this question, it seems to me that this is yet another testament to the power and mystery of art. There, in that paradox of emotion carried on meaningless notes, lies a hint to that great something that all artists pursue without knowing what it is.\nMusic is a great tool in the poet\u0026rsquo;s toolbox. Music without lyrics is preferable for poetic inspiration. Music with words could influence your writing\u0026rsquo;s originality. No, the words are for you to write! Music is just an assistant to your imagination.\nChoose music that, to you, relates to your poem\u0026rsquo;s topic. Keep in mind that this is largely subjective. For example, Federico Mecozzi\u0026rsquo;s Winter Wail was obviously written with snow and sorrow in the composer\u0026rsquo;s mind, but to me, it inspires thoughts of sunlight, of flight, of bittersweet sorrow and confusing passion. Respecting others\u0026rsquo; while following your own artist\u0026rsquo;s intuition is nothing to be ashamed or worried about. Select music that you understand, and make sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bore you. When you listen to it, have your notebook open and your pen poised, and imagine. Let imagery play, and write it down. Go with the music, and let it take you places.\nOne composer I must recommend for poetic work is Ludovico Einaudi. Arguably one of the greatest classical composers of our time, his music is not difficult to understand, while at the same time carrying enough emotional complexity to keep trained ears entertained. His notes are simple, but emotionally finely-tuned. He paints pictures with his music. He paints pictures, and he takes you on a journey through your own memory.\nThere are times when I\u0026rsquo;m not calm enough for poetry. My heart is pounding, my mind is racing, my limbs are fidgeting. I cannot think—I cannot focus on my imagination. I open a window, close my eyes and breathe in the fresh air. Earbuds slide into place. Einuadi\u0026rsquo;s notes wash up like waves on the shores of my consciousness. The room around me fades away and is replaced by eyes, faces, leaves and white clouds.\nAnd now, on a closing note, I\u0026rsquo;d like to address poetry as one of the many expressions of love. Poetry cannot only express love—it is among the loftiest ways of doing so. It brings out the aesthetic side of it, and paints it into scenes and colors we can savor. Love in poetry is honest. It\u0026rsquo;s beautiful, it\u0026rsquo;s frightening, it\u0026rsquo;s haunting. To me, it seems like the very pursuit of the meaning of life itself.\nThere are many kinds of love, and all of them possess their unique beauty in poetic expression. One of my favorites to write about is innocent, youthful love. There is a certain freshness to it, a kind of idyllic quality that makes it the closest thing to fantasy we can experience. It is then that worship of the beauty and glory of each other is complete. We see nothing but perfection, and while one might justly point out what an illusion it all is, at the same time it is the sweetest illusion one might ever experience. And thus it deserves our appreciation and respect.\nThere is a kind of love that lasts forever, and not only so, but burns just as bright as when it was first kindled. It\u0026rsquo;s a love that exists outside of time—completely unaffected by it. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of love that outlasts a lifetime; that death fears. Its power is so great it is almost frightening. It\u0026rsquo;s seeing beauty through the gnarled darkness of old age; it\u0026rsquo;s hiding in the sweetness of the raindrops falling from a bitter, grey sky. It\u0026rsquo;s healing the hand that rose to wound you, and it\u0026rsquo;s wiping the tears away from the face of a stranger.\nOf this let us poets sing. Of the grand, sweeping emotions, of the great thunder and beauty in the human heart. Of the details we all notice, but that nobody notices. Of the beauty all around us, in us and above us.\nThe next time the leaves of your notebook fall open in your lap, don\u0026rsquo;t clench the pen in frustration. Be patient, listen to some music, and dream. And the words will come.\nFor my friend, the Old Gaffer.","href":"https://nicolasgreenwood.github.io/essays/how-to-write-poetry/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2025-04-26T00:00:00Z","objectID":"e043d40aeb76adeb1e2e9621f1e33ae8","publishDate":"2025-04-26T00:00:00Z","section":"essays","tags":[],"title":"How to Write Poetry","type":"essays"},{"content":"Suddenly your hand is in mine We look not at each other’s face We walk on In glorious silence.

Lo, darkness had faded away Faded away Given way to the power of light. Curtains slipped through my fingers To the window was my forehead pressed I closed my eyes And let tears stain the glass — the glass was cold The sun was warm The sun was hot. It was golden! — it washed my face in gold It was light I could feel light Power The power of life. Part 2: Proleće from beneath trees\nShe skipped through the tall grass The hem of her white linen brushing over the blades I followed. The world flew past by me around me through me into me. I heard laughter Everything was blurry was spinning. I brushed my hands over those blades Like the hem of her white linen My steps took me onward I was running I was not running I was dancing I was not dancing I was flying. The trees rustled above Rays of sunlight flickered through them A million flashes Through a million leaves — I smiled As my fingers brushed the rough bark of a trunk. There was a scent in the air Of something fresh Something from long ago That I had once forgotten That I no longer forget Nor remember. We fall to the grass watch clouds finger buds pick dandelions feel our heartbeats. Laughter again My eyes are closed There are hands on my shoulders Breath in my ear. Part 3: Proleće from along sidewalks\nOne by one they slide past — they’re faces, human faces they smile they blink they turn away. ‘Tis a cold wind blowing through these streets Winding through alleyways — an airy serpent — It slithers around buildings Buildings colored pastel With marble busts agape With marble figures adance. Sunlight glitters on concrete I run my fingers over graffiti stains I stop and ponder scene after scene after scene. There is a wrinkled face with the brightest eyes There are raven locks whipped by the wind Webs of dead branches tipped with life Shoes stepping on crosswalks Ashes floating in the breeze. I walk on The cries of children in my ears Against the background of That gentle cacophony of urban traffic Knocking over A basket of apricots, their juice a sweet syrup Glinting in the afternoon sun. Part 4: Proleće from beneath stars\nThe starry host They’re a great choir One great choir Of silence. I could hear their singing As we lay on the cool grass Our arms outstretched Embracing the sky. All over the earth There are whispers — thousands of whispers The cricket’s song The katydid’s chant The bird’s lullaby The mother’s goodnight. I heard them all that night All at once. The world is alive The world is born again The world is hushed in anticipation. For now it is dark And night is the time to dream Of what will take place on the following day: Buds will unfurl Wings will poise and take flight Water will dance and roar before the sun A dragonfly’s wings will reflect a rainbow — the story of spring will be retold As it has For a time longer than our lives. Like a hand pressed against a pane of glass So I reached for the void Stretched above us Spinning ever so slowly Dancing the steady waltz of time Too slow to perceive Yet too swift to risk Letting your eyes close Before they fade away. I reached for it And somehow On that strange, fragrant night My feeble hand Though many a light year away from their burning crowns I knew had touched Their eternal glow If for only one fleeting instant. May the immortal touch the mortal! May the light touch the dark! May life touch death! May sunlight touch the frost and May spring touch the winter.","href":"https://nicolasgreenwood.github.io/poems/prolece/","kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":"2025-03-18T00:00:00Z","objectID":"5e7fd0eb2eb103bae3cc2f224eb1e438","publishDate":"2025-03-18T00:00:00Z","section":"poems","tags":[],"title":"Proleće (Spring)","type":"poems"},{"content":"You remind me of a time When I smiled with tears on my cheeks When you graced me with your presence When I dipped my fingers into the stream.

I watched your waves leap at the clouds Beneath the surface a depth untold You hid with an ominous mantle Of shimmer bright and waves hypnotic A forgotten tale below the light of day. Beneath your ripples of molten lead I glimpsed a world of iridescent blue A place where tears are never shed That fades into darkness’s oblivion Like the sky’s night that fades away. I saw palm trees bent in the wind A wind that made the grains of sand dance Lo, the sky wept; I saw her tears fall The rain lent tears to my windswept cheeks Your angry waves swirled into the bay. Then, like a dream, it was all gone The moonlight reflected off your ripples You whispered something I couldn’t understand Something about love, something about hate Something about a face that slipped away. Ah, tell me, mysterious waves The secrets you hold beneath your foam The sights you saw, the ages that passed you Tell me a story of your origins Of the times before night and day. Did you freeze into an icy stone When you traversed the cosmic hall Glittering with the light of stars All to one day wash these humble shores And splash these cliffs with glorious spray? And what of tomorrow, dear ocean Whither lies your next destination? What alien sky will you reflect? What foreign shores will you carve and sculpt Oh beautiful ocean, so blue, so grey?

Her life’s a dream but a single day long From dawn to dusk lasts her transient flight ‘Tis a life too short to understand wrong For a soul too pure to ever see night.

Alone he was in the whole world Save for the camel at his side With reign in hand and head bowed down He kicked the sand with every stride. His eyes dark beneath his lashes Beneath the cloth glistened his brow His breath came in short tired gasps All his life was forgotten now. It was only the burning rays The ripples in the sea of sand They quivered, they rolled like the waves He was sailing away from land. The dunes hummed the song of the earth His heartbeat sounded in his ears His tongue was dry and his throat choked The sand flashed like a thousand mirrors. He could not breathe, he could not see He was not alive, he was dead He was a carcass with a drum A corpse with a tune in his head. A flick of his wrist and his thumb A hollow thump in step, in beat A light touch of his thumb came next A pause, then eternal repeat. \u0026lsquo;Twas balm to the soul of man To feel the rhythm pulse through him To lose himself in the pattern The tempo of hope and ruin He could hear it in the wind\u0026rsquo;s roar Feel it in the sand in his hand The whole world\u0026rsquo;s moaning in sadness The whole world\u0026rsquo;s tears beneath the sand. Orange glowed beneath his eyelids As linen brushed his weathered cheek Warmth and color fused into dreams Amid the arid gusty shriek. The shriek - it morphed into a scream He saw a girl against the sky Her hair was torn, her face was wet Across the world echoed her cry. The wind - it blew into a hum Of the radio\u0026rsquo;s hiss and wail In the dusty taxis of Cairo Every song an unfinished tale. The car\u0026rsquo;s windows were shaking frames Of scenes through a filter of dust He remembered the shadows\u0026rsquo; shapes On the sun the color of rust. It was so hot he smelled the heat The scent of spark, and steel, and stone He was spinning in red darkness With himself and his dreams alone. A flick of his wrist and his thumb A hollow thump in step, in beat A light touch of his thumb came next A pause, then eternal repeat. Now he was in Giza\u0026rsquo;s alleys Wires crossed the dark sky above The windows were glowing orange His turban as white as a dove. There was rubble all around him There was a fire in his eyes The dream of flight in his bosom There were stars like sparks in the skies That was euphoria, he knew But back then he had forgotten To remember his tearful days From whose womb he was begotten. He had not seen his mother\u0026rsquo;s eyes He had forgotten all of them Now her voice was making him shake Now there was pain inside of him. He was blinded by flashing light Yes, yes - it was a reflection It was from her golden earrings The sun on her smooth complexion Was not that in another world? Not in the world of his closed eyes In his heavy chest, his short gasps Like from hell seeing paradise. He felt the wind in his fingers A tremor shivered through his spine His heartbeat matched the drum\u0026rsquo;s rhythm His lashes the horizon\u0026rsquo;s line. A flick of his wrist and his thumb A hollow thump in step, in beat A light touch of his thumb came next A pause, then eternal repeat. A pattern above the pattern A hidden beat within the beat A song of grief, of wind, of sand Flaming passions drowning in heat. Could a rhythm relive a life? Could a dream add to his years? Could a drum change the heart of man? Could the sun and wind dry his tears? Now he saw a linen pattern It was draped over her bent head Cast carelessly over her shoulder There were stains of blood on the bed He remembered that bright pattern With white lilies from the Nile Against a background of sky blue He thought about that a while. The only beautiful symbol In a room of darkness and pain A patch of sweet color, of hope A patch of sky through clouds of rain. That feeling that burned his bosom No, no - it set him on fire It flooded him and made him fly Higher and higher and higher. He remembered that it was love Ecstasy boiling in him Then laughter spilling out of him His head shaking in the rhythm. A flick of his wrist and his thumb A hollow thump in step, in beat A light touch of his thumb came next A pause, then eternal repeat. The sun and moon exchanged places A piercing cold wind swept the sands Around a pit of dancing flames The Bedouin clan warmed their hands. The ever-present drum echoed It resounded through the cold air Alone in majestic silence Beneath the whitish moonlit glare. Allah! Hear the sons of men\u0026rsquo;s sounds Hear their senseless beat, mad delight In so puny a thing - the drum Lo, they lose themselves all the night. Lose themselves in a strange pattern One only they can feel and hear It\u0026rsquo;s a mirage in the rhythm It\u0026rsquo;s an illusion in the ear. Oh Allah, see our senseless joy Have mercy on the souls of men For we are blown like grains of sand From sorrow to joy like children. Our passions are like gusts of wind One moment a hum, then a scream Foaming at the lips with madness Of delight at a passing dream To dripping at the eyes with tears At grief we do not understand Oh Allah, have mercy on us! We have fallen - extend your hand!

Through bluish haze I see waving palms The pyramids of Giza stand behind Like sentinels of this enchanted land Their monolithic presence slows the time. I step forward, my vision bathed in light In my ear the wind whispers ancient tales Of Pharaohs, of magic, of mighty acts Of great warriors whose heart never quails. Of thundering horses and chariots Of the battle, of the uplifted spear Of a past era of glory untold A great empire the whole world did fear. Visions pass before my astonished eyes I see gold and palaces bright; I see the glory and pomp of the gods Bugles are blown, men tremble in his sight. Son of the sun he is, of divine kin The ground shakes beneath his golden sandals The sun glitters against his golden mask The wind blows his royal purple mantles. Garlands, flowers of color brilliant Tossed by his subjects, do adorn his path; For he is Pharaoh, the divine of earth Lord of all, and fatal is his wrath. He fades away, a new vision appears Of dunes, of camels; through a hazy mist The Arab leads his precious caravan His first camel’s reigns wrapped around his wrist. On their bactrian backs sugar canes strapped; Others silk, velvet - treasures of the east Their hooves leave clouds of swirling yellow dust They stomp and sway, not tired in the least. The Bedouin’s face, half covered with cloth The hollows of his eyes a dark shadow; The wind blows and rips at his long white robes His steps on the sand are sift and mellow. In these vast horizons he is alone It is only him and Allah his God; His thoughts are deep, the world he contemplates As he trudges forward clutching his rod.

The faces of Cairo pass my vision; Glittering black eyes, sculpted face, black hair Oriental fabrics wrapped around them Their step and their gait is so strong, so fair. My fingers are trailing over red stone The wind whistles through its porous surface; I feel so small, so insignificant And yet I feel I have found my purpose: Is it not nothing else but to stand here And feel the desert wind blow over me As my eyes fill with tears of happiness And the warm Egyptian rays cover me? To feel the grains of sand in my fingers As my vision quivers with heated sheen? To faint into the arms of the hot wind And be carried away into a dream Of Pharaohs and gold; of empires bright Of Arabs and camels, the golden sun The Nile that flows to eternity To the Mediterranean his son.
